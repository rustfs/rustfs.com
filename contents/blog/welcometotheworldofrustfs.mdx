# Hello, and welcome to the world of RustFS！


## Why Did We Develop RustFS?

Globally, object storage is gaining popularity in various domains, such as storage-compute separation, cloud storage, private storage, data lakes, and cost-effective storage solutions, all of which extensively utilize the S3 protocol for distributed object storage.

However, some distributed object storage software deviates from the original intent of open source by introducing licenses with legal traps or dual licensing schemes.

We aspire to contribute to humanity and the world—enhancing data security and reducing storage costs for all.

## Why Did We Choose to Rewrite Object Storage with Rust?

Rust is currently the world’s most popular and secure programming language.

Several key factors have driven Rust’s widespread recognition and popularity:

1. **Safety**: Rust’s core feature is memory safety. Through mechanisms like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, Rust prevents issues such as null pointers and data races at compile time without relying on garbage collection, making it particularly well-suited for systems programming.
   
2. **Performance**: Rust’s compiler generates highly efficient machine code comparable to traditional system programming languages like C/C++, making it ideal for high-performance scenarios.

3. **Modern Language Features**: Rust includes modern programming features such as pattern matching, type inference, concurrency support, and zero-cost abstractions, which improve development efficiency and code quality.

4. **Cross-Platform**: Rust supports cross-platform development, allowing programs to run on various operating systems and hardware platforms, including embedded systems.

5. **System Programming**: Rust is viewed as a modern alternative to C/C++ for writing safe and reliable system software.

6. **WebAssembly**: Rust can compile to WebAssembly, enabling Rust code to run in web browsers and opening new possibilities for web development.

7. **Enterprise Support**: Major tech companies like Mozilla (Rust’s creator), Dropbox, Coursera, and Microsoft use or support Rust, building trust in the language.

8. **Open-Source Projects**: Numerous well-known open-source projects, such as Firefox, TensorFlow, Deno, and ripgrep, use Rust, boosting its visibility and reputation.

9. **Continuous Development**: Rust’s development team frequently releases new versions, introducing features and improvements, demonstrating its vitality and evolution.

Given these advantages, we chose Rust to rewrite a distributed object storage system.
